# Data Analyst Project
In this Project, I have analyzed sales data which was taken from kaggle.
First step is to install Power BI(Just google Power BI Desktop to install it).
Download the data from Kaggle and import it into Power BI(Home -> Get Data->Excel WorkBook->Transform)).
Analysed what needs to be done from the data
Now in Power Query, i have performed data transformation using DAX and some inbuilt functions.
After Data Cleaning & Transformation i have created dashboard which is completely interactive.
